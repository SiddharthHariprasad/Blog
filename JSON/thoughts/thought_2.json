At first I thought it was something out of the ordinary, but then I had a feeling that then everything in this world would be extraordinary. And that's not true, so I kept on thinking to know what is extraordinary!, amazing!, incredible!, and it struck to me just like a lightning on a sunny day, <b>SCIENCE + CREATIVITY = EXTRAORDINARY.</b> Why? Because science has been mostly the main part of everything we have today that is extraordinary. And about creativity, well its like the chocolate in the chocolate milkshake, creativity fuels the fire of science. It creates a sense of belief, it gives you power to dream and that's what we perceive as extraordinary."
